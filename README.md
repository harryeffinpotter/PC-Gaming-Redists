### DECEMBER 2025 UPDATE:
- **Fixed silent failing** - Script no longer pretends everything is fine when WinGet is broken/missing
- **WinGet auto-install** - Automatic installation under more scenarios/fresh Windows installs
- **Better detection** - Added extensive checks to verify WinGet is actually working
- **Useless packages skip** - No longer attempts to install ARM64/Uninstaller/Developer packages.
- **Fresh install support** - Should now work on fresh Windows installs (user testing appreciated!)
- **Shortened URL** - Shortened the URL for those of us who can't copy+paste to the target machine easily!
